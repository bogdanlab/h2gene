# h2gene

h2gene is a method for partitioning gene-level contributions to complex-trait heritability by allele frequency (or any other binary annotations).

Check out the bioRxiv manuscript [Burch, Hou et al. "Partitioning gene-level contributions to complex-trait heritability by allele frequency identifies disease-relevant genes"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.17.456722v1).
